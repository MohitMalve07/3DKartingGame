/// <summary>
/// Attaches to the PLAYER PREFAB ONLY. On spawn, the local owner finds the scene's
/// CinemachineCamera and assigns Follow/LookAt to this player's transform.
///
/// Uses a delayed coroutine-based initialization to avoid a Cinemachine timing issue
/// where the CinemachineFollow component captures a stale reference frame when the
/// target is assigned before the player's spawn position has settled.
///
/// WHY THIS IS NEEDED:
/// CinemachineFollow with "Lock To Target With World Up" binding mode captures its
/// internal reference frame (the coordinate system for Follow Offset) at the moment
/// it first detects a target. In WebGL builds with Relay, OnNetworkSpawn() fires
/// before the player transform reaches its final spawn position — the player may
/// still be at origin (0,0,0) or mid-teleport from SpawnManager. Cinemachine locks
/// to that stale frame and never recalculates, causing the camera to point at the
/// wrong location. Manually toggling Binding Mode in the Inspector forces a
/// recalculation, which is why that workaround works.
///
/// The fix: wait for the spawn position to settle, then assign targets + force
/// Cinemachine to snap its internal state to the correct position.
///
/// SETUP:
/// 1. Place a CinemachineCamera in the Game scene (NOT on the player prefab).
/// 2. Attach this script to the root of the player prefab (same GameObject as NetworkObject).
/// 3. No tags or Inspector drag-and-drop needed — resolution is fully automatic.
/// </summary>
